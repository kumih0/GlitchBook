  ## Description
  
  GlitchBook - Social Networking: Disrupted.  Have you ever found yourself enjoying social media a bit too much and wish there was a  worse way? This is the social network for you! Challenge yourself and others to try and use this app!

  - GlitchBook is a fullstack application written in Node.js, Express for our backend server, Mongoose/MongoDB for the database, Apollo Server and Apollo Client with GraphQL, and the client server in React. 
  = User authentication utilizes JSON Web Token and will dynamically update and runs a randomized seed for the database.
  - After randomized seeds are run, you can access the list of user logins in the userDataSeeds.json file, (including MongoDB's unique _id and the user's unhashed passwords.)

 ## Tests 
 
 It only works if it doesn't.  Test it if you dare! 

After installing necessary dependencies, don't forget to run `npm run seeds` to seed the database with dummy data.  Run as many times as you like to try things out!

The following command `npm rum develop` will begin the client and backend servers simultaneously.
